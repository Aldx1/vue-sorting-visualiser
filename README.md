# sorting-visualiser

A sorting algorithm visualiser app built with Vue and TypeScript.

Implemented in a way to pass data between stores and components.
Just designed like this to get used to Vue stores and refs.
Used Pinia for the store.

Could have designed it in a way so the sorting algorithm performed the animation directly.

Decided to design it so when an array is defined, all sorting algorithms will perform their respective sorts.

### todo

Add controls.
Add pseudo highlighting to show which part of the algorithm that particular step belongs to.
Add table to document the difference in performance between the algorithms.
